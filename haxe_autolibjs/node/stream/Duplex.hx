		The `writable.write()` method writes some data to the stream, and calls the
		supplied `callback` once the data has been fully handled. If an error
		occurs, the `callback` will be called with the error as its
		first argument. The `callback` is called asynchronously and before `'error'` is
		emitted.

		The return value is `true` if the internal buffer is less than the`highWaterMark` configured when the stream was created after admitting `chunk`.
		If `false` is returned, further attempts to write data to the stream should
		stop until the `'drain'` event is emitted.

		While a stream is not draining, calls to `write()` will buffer `chunk`, and
		return false. Once all currently buffered chunks are drained (accepted for
		delivery by the operating system), the `'drain'` event will be emitted.
		It is recommended that once `write()` returns false, no more chunks be written
		until the `'drain'` event is emitted. While calling `write()` on a stream that
		is not draining is allowed, Node.js will buffer all written chunks until
		maximum memory usage occurs, at which point it will abort unconditionally.
		Even before it aborts, high memory usage will cause poor garbage collector
		performance and high RSS (which is not typically released back to the system,
		even after the memory is no longer required). Since TCP sockets may never
		drain if the remote peer does not read the data, writing a socket that is
		not draining may lead to a remotely exploitable vulnerability.

		Writing data while the stream is not draining is particularly
		problematic for a `Transform`, because the `Transform` streams are paused
		by default until they are piped or a `'data'` or `'readable'` event handler
		is added.

		If the data to be written can be generated or fetched on demand, it is
		recommended to encapsulate the logic into a `Readable` and use {@link pipe}. However, if calling `write()` is preferred, it is
		possible to respect backpressure and avoid memory issues using the `'drain'` event:

		```js
		function write(data, cb) {
		   if (!stream.write(data)) {
			 stream.once('drain', cb);
		   } else {
			 process.nextTick(cb);
		   }
		}

		// Wait for cb to be called before doing any other write.
		write('hello', () => {
		   console.log('Write completed, do more writes now.');
		});
		```

		// ...

		```

		`removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the
		listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the
		listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be
		called multiple times to remove each instance.

		Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the
		time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any`removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls _after_ emitting and_before_ the last listener finishes execution will
		not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

		```js
		const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

		const callbackA = () => {
		   console.log('A');
		   myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
		};

		const callbackB = () => {
		   console.log('B');
		};

		myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

		myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

		// callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
		// Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
		myEmitter.emit('event');
		// Prints:
		//   A
		//   B

		// callbackB is now removed.
		// Internal listener array [callbackA]
		myEmitter.emit('event');
		// Prints:
		//   A
		```

		Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will
		change the position indices of any listener registered _after_ the listener
		being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called,
		but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by
		the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

		When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single
		event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most
		recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')`listener is removed:

		```js
		const ee = new EventEmitter();

		function pong() {
		   console.log('pong');
		}

		ee.on('ping', pong);
		ee.once('ping', pong);
		ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

		being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called,
		but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by
		the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

		When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single
		event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most
		recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')`listener is removed:

		```js
		const ee = new EventEmitter();

		function pong() {
		   console.log('pong');
		}

		ee.on('ping', pong);
		ee.once('ping', pong);
		ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

		ee.emit('ping');
		ee.emit('ping');
		```

		Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.

		Removes the specified `listener` from the listener array for the event named`eventName`.

		```js
		const callback = (stream) => {
		   console.log('someone connected!');
		};
		server.on('connection', callback);
		// ...
		server.removeListener('connection', callback);
		```

		`removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the
		listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the
		listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be
		called multiple times to remove each instance.

		Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the
		time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any`removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls _after_ emitting and_before_ the last listener finishes execution will
		not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.

		```js
		const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

		const callbackA = () => {
		   console.log('A');
		   myEmitter.removeListener('event', callbackB);
		};

		const callbackB = () => {
		   console.log('B');
		};

		myEmitter.on('event', callbackA);

		myEmitter.on('event', callbackB);

		// callbackA removes listener callbackB but it will still be called.
		// Internal listener array at time of emit [callbackA, callbackB]
		myEmitter.emit('event');
		// Prints:
		//   A
		//   B

		// callbackB is now removed.
		// Internal listener array [callbackA]
		myEmitter.emit('event');
		// Prints:
		//   A
		```

		Because listeners are managed using an internal array, calling this will
		change the position indices of any listener registered _after_ the listener
		being removed. This will not impact the order in which listeners are called,
		but it means that any copies of the listener array as returned by
		the `emitter.listeners()` method will need to be recreated.

		When a single function has been added as a handler multiple times for a single
		event (as in the example below), `removeListener()` will remove the most
		recently added instance. In the example the `once('ping')`listener is removed:

		```js
		const ee = new EventEmitter();

		function pong() {
		   console.log('pong');
		}

		ee.on('ping', pong);
		ee.once('ping', pong);
		ee.removeListener('ping', pong);

		ee.emit('ping');
		ee.emit('ping');
		```

		Returns a reference to the `EventEmitter`, so that calls can be chained.
