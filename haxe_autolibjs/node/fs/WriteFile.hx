	When `file` is a filename, asynchronously writes data to the file, replacing the
	file if it already exists. `data` can be a string or a buffer.

	When `file` is a file descriptor, the behavior is similar to calling`fs.write()` directly (which is recommended). See the notes below on using
	a file descriptor.

	The `encoding` option is ignored if `data` is a buffer.

	If `data` is a plain object, it must have an own (not inherited) `toString`function property.

	```js
	import { writeFile } from 'fs';
	import { Buffer } from 'buffer';

	const data = new Uint8Array(Buffer.from('Hello Node.js'));
	writeFile('message.txt', data, (err) => {
	   if (err) throw err;
	   console.log('The file has been saved!');
	});
	```

	If `options` is a string, then it specifies the encoding:

	```js
	import { writeFile } from 'fs';

	writeFile('message.txt', 'Hello Node.js', 'utf8', callback);
	```

	It is unsafe to use `fs.writeFile()` multiple times on the same file without
	waiting for the callback. For this scenario, {@link createWriteStream} is
	recommended.

	Similarly to `fs.readFile` \- `fs.writeFile` is a convenience method that
	performs multiple `write` calls internally to write the buffer passed to it.
	For performance sensitive code consider using {@link createWriteStream}.

	It is possible to use an `AbortSignal` to cancel an `fs.writeFile()`.
	Cancelation is "best effort", and some amount of data is likely still
	to be written.

	```js
	import { writeFile } from 'fs';
	import { Buffer } from 'buffer';

	const controller = new AbortController();
	const { signal } = controller;
	const data = new Uint8Array(Buffer.from('Hello Node.js'));
	writeFile('message.txt', data, { signal }, (err) => {
	   // When a request is aborted - the callback is called with an AbortError
	});
	// When the request should be aborted
	controller.abort();
	```

	Aborting an ongoing request does not abort individual operating
	system requests but rather the internal buffering `fs.writeFile` performs.
