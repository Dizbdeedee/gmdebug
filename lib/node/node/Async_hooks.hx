		   async_hooks.executionAsyncId();

		   // callbacks passed to .listen() are wrapped in a nextTick().
		   async_hooks.executionAsyncId();

		Resource objects returned by `executionAsyncResource()` are most often internal
		Node.js handle objects with undocumented APIs. Using any functions or properties
		on the object is likely to crash your application and should be avoided.
		
		Using `executionAsyncResource()` in the top-level execution context will
		return an empty object as there is no handle or request object to use,
		but having an object representing the top-level can be helpful.
		
		```js
		import { open } from 'fs';
		import { executionAsyncId, executionAsyncResource } from 'async_hooks';
		
		console.log(executionAsyncId(), executionAsyncResource());  // 1 {}
		open(new URL(import.meta.url), 'r', (err, fd) => {
		   console.log(executionAsyncId(), executionAsyncResource());  // 7 FSReqWrap
		});
		```
		
		This can be used to implement continuation local storage without the
		use of a tracking `Map` to store the metadata:
		
		```js
		import { createServer } from 'http';
		import {
		   executionAsyncId,
		   executionAsyncResource,
		   createHook
		} from 'async_hooks';
		const sym = Symbol('state'); // Private symbol to avoid pollution
		
		createHook({
		   init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource) {
		     const cr = executionAsyncResource();
		     if (cr) {
		       resource[sym] = cr[sym];
		     }
		   }
		}).enable();
		
		const server = createServer((req, res) => {
		   executionAsyncResource()[sym] = { state: req.url };
		   setTimeout(function() {
		     res.end(JSON.stringify(executionAsyncResource()[sym]));
		   }, 100);
		}).listen(3000);
		```

		Registers functions to be called for different lifetime events of each async
		operation.
		
		The callbacks `init()`/`before()`/`after()`/`destroy()` are called for the
		respective asynchronous event during a resource's lifetime.
		
		All callbacks are optional. For example, if only resource cleanup needs to
		be tracked, then only the `destroy` callback needs to be passed. The
		specifics of all functions that can be passed to `callbacks` is in the `Hook Callbacks` section.
		
		```js
		import { createHook } from 'async_hooks';
		
		const asyncHook = createHook({
		   init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource) { },
		   destroy(asyncId) { }
		});
		```
		
		The callbacks will be inherited via the prototype chain:
		
		```js
		class MyAsyncCallbacks {
		   init(asyncId, type, triggerAsyncId, resource) { }
		   destroy(asyncId) {}
		}
		
		class MyAddedCallbacks extends MyAsyncCallbacks {
		   before(asyncId) { }
		   after(asyncId) { }
		}
		
		const asyncHook = async_hooks.createHook(new MyAddedCallbacks());
		```
		
		Because promises are asynchronous resources whose lifecycle is tracked
		via the async hooks mechanism, the `init()`, `before()`, `after()`, and`destroy()` callbacks _must not_ be async functions that return promises.
