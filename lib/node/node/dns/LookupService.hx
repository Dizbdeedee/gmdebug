	Resolves the given `address` and `port` into a host name and service using
	the operating system's underlying `getnameinfo` implementation.
	
	If `address` is not a valid IP address, a `TypeError` will be thrown.
	The `port` will be coerced to a number. If it is not a legal port, a `TypeError`will be thrown.
	
	On an error, `err` is an `Error` object, where `err.code` is the error code.
	
	```js
	const dns = require('dns');

	   console.log(hostname, service);
	   // Prints: localhost ssh
	});
	```
	
	If this method is invoked as its `util.promisify()` ed version, it returns a`Promise` for an `Object` with `hostname` and `service` properties.
