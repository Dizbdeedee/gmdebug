/**
	Resolves a host name (e.g. `'nodejs.org'`) into the first found A (IPv4) or
	AAAA (IPv6) record. All `option` properties are optional. If `options` is an
	integer, then it must be `4` or `6` – if `options` is not provided, then IPv4
	and IPv6 addresses are both returned if found.
	
	With the `all` option set to `true`, the arguments for `callback` change to`(err, addresses)`, with `addresses` being an array of objects with the
	properties `address` and `family`.
	
	On error, `err` is an `Error` object, where `err.code` is the error code.
	Keep in mind that `err.code` will be set to `'ENOTFOUND'` not only when
	the host name does not exist but also when the lookup fails in other ways
	such as no available file descriptors.
	
	`dns.lookup()` does not necessarily have anything to do with the DNS protocol.
	The implementation uses an operating system facility that can associate names
	with addresses, and vice versa. This implementation can have subtle but
	important consequences on the behavior of any Node.js program. Please take some
	time to consult the `Implementation considerations section` before using`dns.lookup()`.
	
	Example usage:
	
	```js
	const dns = require('dns');
	const options = {
	   family: 6,
	   hints: dns.ADDRCONFIG | dns.V4MAPPED,
	};
	dns.lookup('example.com', options, (err, address, family) =>
	   console.log('address: %j family: IPv%s', address, family));
	// address: "2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946" family: IPv6
	
	// When options.all is true, the result will be an Array.
	options.all = true;
	dns.lookup('example.com', options, (err, addresses) =>
	   console.log('addresses: %j', addresses));
	// addresses: [{"address":"2606:2800:220:1:248:1893:25c8:1946","family":6}]
	```
	
	If this method is invoked as its `util.promisify()` ed version, and `all`is not set to `true`, it returns a `Promise` for an `Object` with `address` and`family` properties.
