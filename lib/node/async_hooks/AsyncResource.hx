/**
	The class `AsyncResource` is designed to be extended by the embedder's async
	resources. Using this, users can easily trigger the lifetime events of their
	own resources.
	
	The `init` hook will trigger when an `AsyncResource` is instantiated.
	
	The following is an overview of the `AsyncResource` API.
	
	```js
	import { AsyncResource, executionAsyncId } from 'async_hooks';
	
	// AsyncResource() is meant to be extended. Instantiating a
	// new AsyncResource() also triggers init. If triggerAsyncId is omitted then
	// async_hook.executionAsyncId() is used.
	const asyncResource = new AsyncResource(
	   type, { triggerAsyncId: executionAsyncId(), requireManualDestroy: false }
	);
	
	// Run a function in the execution context of the resource. This will
	// * establish the context of the resource
	// * trigger the AsyncHooks before callbacks
	// * call the provided function `fn` with the supplied arguments
	// * trigger the AsyncHooks after callbacks
	// * restore the original execution context
	asyncResource.runInAsyncScope(fn, thisArg, ...args);
	
	// Call AsyncHooks destroy callbacks.
	asyncResource.emitDestroy();
	
	// Return the unique ID assigned to the AsyncResource instance.
	asyncResource.asyncId();
	
	// Return the trigger ID for the AsyncResource instance.
	asyncResource.triggerAsyncId();
	```
