		`removeListener()` will remove, at most, one instance of a listener from the
		listener array. If any single listener has been added multiple times to the
		listener array for the specified `eventName`, then `removeListener()` must be
		called multiple times to remove each instance.
		
		Once an event is emitted, all listeners attached to it at the
		time of emitting are called in order. This implies that any`removeListener()` or `removeAllListeners()` calls _after_ emitting and_before_ the last listener finishes execution will
		not remove them from`emit()` in progress. Subsequent events behave as expected.
		
		```js
		const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();
