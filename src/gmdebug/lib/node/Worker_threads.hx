/**
	The `worker_threads` module enables the use of threads that execute JavaScript
	in parallel. To access it:

	```js
	const worker = require('worker_threads');
	```

	Workers (threads) are useful for performing CPU-intensive JavaScript operations.
	They do not help much with I/O-intensive work. The Node.js built-in
	asynchronous I/O operations are more efficient than Workers can be.

	Unlike `child_process` or `cluster`, `worker_threads` can share memory. They do
	so by transferring `ArrayBuffer` instances or sharing `SharedArrayBuffer`instances.

	```js
	const {
	   Worker, isMainThread, parentPort, workerData
	} = require('worker_threads');

	if (isMainThread) {
	   module.exports = function parseJSAsync(script) {
		 return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		   const worker = new Worker(__filename, {
			 workerData: script
		   });
		   worker.on('message', resolve);
		   worker.on('error', reject);
		   worker.on('exit', (code) => {
			 if (code !== 0)
			   reject(new Error(`Worker stopped with exit code ${code}`));
		   });
		 });
	   };
	} else {
	   const { parse } = require('some-js-parsing-library');
	   const script = workerData;
	   parentPort.postMessage(parse(script));
	}
	```

	The above example spawns a Worker thread for each `parse()` call. In actual
	practice, use a pool of Workers for these kinds of tasks. Otherwise, the
	overhead of creating Workers would likely exceed their benefit.

	When implementing a worker pool, use the `AsyncResource` API to inform
	diagnostic tools (e.g. to provide asynchronous stack traces) about the
	correlation between tasks and their outcomes. See `"Using AsyncResource for a Worker thread pool"` in the `async_hooks` documentation for an example implementation.

	Worker threads inherit non-process-specific options by default. Refer to `Worker constructor options` to know how to customize worker thread options,
	specifically `argv` and `execArgv` options.

		// The following line prints the contents of typedArray1 -- it still owns
		// its memory and has been cloned, not transferred. Without
		// `markAsUntransferable()`, this would print an empty Uint8Array.
		// typedArray2 is intact as well.
		console.log(typedArray1);
		console.log(typedArray2);
		```

		There is no equivalent to this API in browsers.
