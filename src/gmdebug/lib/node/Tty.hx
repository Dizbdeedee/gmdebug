/**
	The `tty` module provides the `tty.ReadStream` and `tty.WriteStream` classes.
	In most cases, it will not be necessary or possible to use this module directly.
	However, it can be accessed using:
	
	```js
	const tty = require('tty');
	```
	
	When Node.js detects that it is being run with a text terminal ("TTY")
	attached, `process.stdin` will, by default, be initialized as an instance of`tty.ReadStream` and both `process.stdout` and `process.stderr` will, by
	default, be instances of `tty.WriteStream`. The preferred method of determining
	whether Node.js is being run within a TTY context is to check that the value of
	the `process.stdout.isTTY` property is `true`:
	
	```console
	$ node -p -e "Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)"
	true
	$ node -p -e "Boolean(process.stdout.isTTY)" | cat
	false
	```
	
	In most cases, there should be little to no reason for an application to
	manually create instances of the `tty.ReadStream` and `tty.WriteStream`classes.
